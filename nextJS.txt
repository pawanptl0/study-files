Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

In Next.js, compilation happens during the development stage as you edit your code, and as part of the build step to prepare your application for production.
Minification is the process of removing unnecessary code formatting and comments without changing the code’s functionality. The goal is to improve the application’s performance by decreasing file sizes.

Code-splitting is the process of splitting the application’s bundle into smaller chunks required by each entry point.

With Next.js, three types of rendering methods are available: Server-Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, and Client-Side Rendering.

Pre-Rendering
Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation are also referred to as Pre-Rendering because the fetching of external data and transformation of React components into HTML happens before the result is sent to the client.

Server-Side Rendering
With server-side rendering, the HTML of the page is generated on a server for each request. The generated HTML, JSON data, and JavaScript instructions to make the page interactive are then sent to the client.


Static Site Generation
With Static Site Generation, the HTML is generated on the server, content is generated once, at build time, when the application is deployed, and the HTML is stored in a CDN and re-used for each request.

create next js application
npm: npx create-next-app my-app
yarn: yarn create next-app my-app

go to my-app folder and run 'yarn run dev'

Client-Side Navigation:
The Link component enables client-side navigation between two pages in the same Next.js app.
import Link from 'next/link'.
<a> do full refresh but <Link> do necessary contents refresh.

Next.js automatically optimizes your application for the best performance by code splitting, client-side navigation, and prefetching (in production).

If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an <a> tag without Link.

html <header>
import Head from 'next/head'
add <Head> in return() with <title>

image:
import Image from "next/image"
<Image src="" height={300} width={300} alt="" />

add external script innto <Head>
import Script from 'next/script'
<Script
        src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"
        strategy="lazyOnload"
        onLoad={() =>
          console.log(`script loaded correctly, window.FB has been populated`)
        }
      />


      



{' '} adds an empty space, which is used to divide text over multiple lines.

React:
React is Declarative library.
'react-dom' provides DOM-specific methods that enable you to use React with the DOM.
pass pieces of information as properties to React components. These are called props.

Once you save the file, you should notice the browser automatically updates to reflect the change.
This feature is called Fast Refresh. It gives you instantaneous feedback on any edits you make
